# Automated Factory (Micro-Controller Project)
This project can measure weight and class of the product. Then send it to its designated destination/box. We used a YOLOv3 trained model for detecting product. ESP32 for capture and sending image via wifi. Load cell and hx711 for weight measure. LCD display to show product count and weight. Servo motor to move product. DC motor to rotate Conveyor belt. Details are explained in the video.
